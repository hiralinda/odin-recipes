    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Brigadeiro is a traditional Brazilian dessert, often described as a chocolate truffle. It's made from condensed
        milk, cocoa powder, and butter, and is typically rolled into small balls and covered with chocolate sprinkles.
        This sweet treat is a staple at Brazilian birthday parties and other celebrations.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (14 oz) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>Chocolate sprinkles for coating</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium saucepan, combine the sweetened condensed milk, cocoa powder, and butter.</li>
        <li>Cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens and easily pulls away from the
            bottom of the pan when you scrape it with your spoon (about 10-15 minutes).</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and transfer the mixture to a plate or bowl. Let it cool to room temperature.</li>
        <li>Once cooled, grease your hands with butter and roll the mixture into small balls (about 1 inch in diameter).
        </li>
        <li>Roll each ball in chocolate sprinkles to coat.</li>
        <li>Place the brigadeiros in small paper cups.</li>
        <li>Serve at room temperature or slightly chilled. Enjoy!</li>
